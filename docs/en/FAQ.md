## History

### What is Bar Citizens International?

Bar Citizen International (BCI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and empowering the Star Citizen community. Our mission is to make hosting Bar Citizen events easier, more enjoyable, and more impactful for coordinators worldwide. 

Back in 2016, during the formation of the International Discords, there was considerable discussion around what title should be used for those helping to organize community gatherings. Terms like Manager or Organizer were considered but ultimately set aside, as they implied a level of authority or hierarchy that didn’t reflect the spirit of the community.


### What is a "Coordinator?"

Back in 2016, during the formation of the International Discords, there was considerable discussion around what title should be used for those helping to organize community gatherings. Terms like Manager or Organizer were considered but ultimately set aside, as they implied a level of authority or hierarchy that didn’t reflect the spirit of the community.

Coordinator was chosen because it better captured the role: someone who, like any other Citizen of the 'Verse, simply wants to help bring fans together in real life. The title isn’t meant to elevate one person above another—it’s just a way to refer to those who volunteer their time to help fellow Star Citizen fans connect. It reflects the attitude that these events are “By the fans, For the fans.”

### Can I Charge for my Event?

Bar Citizen events are specifically for the enjoyment of the fans who create them and should not be used to generate profit for any individual or business. An exception might be made by CIG for special circumstances. One such exception was granted to Bar Citizen International (BCI) however, it should be noted that BCI is a non-profit organization, all of the staff are unpaid volunteers, and any money made is used to support and promote Bar Citizen events and their coordination.

### How often should my events be?

The frequency of events is up to the coordinator. Regular meetups (monthly or quarterly) help build a consistent community, but it's important to consider local interest and availability. One thing to consider is having a consistent frequency. Whether monthly or quarterly, it is important to be consistent. Consistency provides exposure via announcements to potential new attendees. Without consistency many who are interested will assume your event was a one time occurrence and may never look for a repeat event.

### Where should my events be?

Bar Citizens can be held at a variety of venues, such as parks, lounges, houses, restaurants, and entertainment centers. However, most Bar Citizens have been held at breweries or bars that serve food or at restaurants.

### Should I make a reservation at my chosen venue?

This depends upon the venue and expected attendance. However, for any group larger than 4-5 persons making a reservation is recommended. A reservation is definitely recommended for larger groups. It ensures you have enough space and helps the venue prepare for your event.

### Should I ask people to sign up?

This depends on your event. It does help out with tracking and understanding if your venue is the right size.
What percentage of people who sign up will actually show up?
It varies, but a good rule of thumb is to expect about 50-75% of those who express interest to actually attend.

### What time should my event be?

The best time for your event depends on your local community. Evenings and weekends generally work best, but consider what works for your attendees.

###How long should my event be?

This really depends upon the attendees. However, most events last between 2-4 hours. This can vary depending on the venue and the activities planned.

### Should I provide appetizers or beverages?

Most events are held at locations that server beverages and/or food. However, if your event is held at a venue that doesn't serve food or beverages, providing appetizers or beverages can enhance the event experience, but it's not required. If your venue offers food and drinks, encourage attendees to purchase their own.

### What should I say to the venue?

When contacting the venue, explain that you're organizing a fan meetup for Star Citizen players, provide an estimated number of attendees, and inquire about any reservations or accommodations needed.

### Can I make money of hosting a bar citizen?
Short answer is NO. Bar Citizen events are specifically for the enjoyment of the fans who create them and should not be used to generate profit for any individual or business. An exception might be made by CIG for special circumstances. One of those exceptions was granted to Bar Citizen International (BCI); however, it should be noted that BCI is a non-profit organization, all of the staff are unpaid volunteers, and any money that is made is kept and used by the organization to support and promote Bar Citizen events and the coordination of Bar Citizen events.
